The system admins team of xFusionCorp Industries needs to deploy a new application on App Server 2 in Stratos Datacenter. They have some pre-requites to get ready that server for application deployment. Prepare the server as per requirements shared below:



1. Install and configure nginx on App Server 2.


2. On App Server 2 there is a self signed SSL certificate and key present at location /tmp/nautilus.crt and /tmp/nautilus.key. Move them to some appropriate location and deploy the same in Nginx.


3. Create an index.html file with content Welcome! under Nginx document root.


4. For final testing try to access the App Server 2 link (either hostname or IP) from jump host using curl command. For example curl -Ik https://<app-server-ip>/.

Solution:
 install Ngnix: yum install ngnix -y
      O/P: NO NGNIX FOUND
    NGNIX PACKAGE WILL BE FOUND IN EPEL REPO:
    go to the above path and install the NGINX
     S1: YUM INSTALL EPEL-REPO
     S2:YUM INSTALL NGINX -y

S2: MV .crt, .key files to appropriate folder
    mkdir /etc/nginx/ssl
    mv /tmp/nautilus.crt /etc/nginx/ssl
    mv /tmp/nautilus.key /etc/nginx/ssl

open nginx.conf file
    modify the configurations
    go to server section 
      add ip address
      change the path of .key,.crt files

s3: create index.html
    path : /usr/share/nginx/html
    cd the above path
    rm index.html
    vi index.html -- > Welcome
s4:
  nginx -t
  systemctl enable nginx
  systemctl start nginx

Testing:
 jumphost : curl -Iktony@ https://stapp01/
