xFusionCorp Industries is planning to host two static websites on their infra in Stratos Datacenter. The development of these websites is still in-progress, but we want to get the servers ready. Please perform the following steps to accomplish the task:


a. Install httpd package and dependencies on app server 2.

b. Apache should serve on port 3003.

c. There are two website's backups /home/thor/ecommerce and /home/thor/apps on jump_host. Set them up on Apache in a way that ecommerce should work on the link http://localhost:3003/ecommerce/ and apps should work on link http://localhost:3003/apps/ on the mentioned app server.

d. Once configured you should be able to access the website using curl command on the respective app server, i.e curl http://localhost:3003/ecommerce/ and curl http://localhost:3003/apps/

Solution:
 1. install httpd
 2. mv the files from : scp jump@host to steve@stapp02:~/
 3  mv these folders to httpd html directory /var/www/html
      sudo mv ecommerce/ apps/ /var/www/html
4. change the port number 
    vi /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf
change the port no: 3003
