xFusionCorp Industries is planning to host a WordPress website on their infra in Stratos Datacenter. They have already done infrastructure configurationâ€”for example, on the storage server they already have a shared directory /vaw/www/html that is mounted on each app host under /var/www/html directory. Please perform the following steps to accomplish the task:

a. Install httpd, php and its dependencies on all app hosts.
b. Apache should serve on port 8086 within the apps.
c. Install/Configure MariaDB server on DB Server.
d. Create a database named kodekloud_db1 and create a database user named kodekloud_rin identified as password BruCStnMT5. Further make sure this newly created user is able to perform all operation on the database you created.
e. Finally you should be able to access the website on LBR link, by clicking on the App button on the top bar. You should see a message like App is able to connect to the database using user kodekloud_rin

Solution:
S1: Install all dependecies on all servers i.e. stapp01, stapp02, stapp03
Install PHP: sudo dnf install php php-opcache php-gd php-curl php-mysqlnd
Install httpd: yum install httpd -y

systemctl enable httpd && systemctl start httpd && systemctl status httpd

change the port number : vi /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf
 change the port number to 8086

restart the httpd : systemctl restart httpd
check : curl localhost:8086

S2: INSTALL MARIADB IN APP2:
  yum install mariadb mariadb-server -y
  systemctl enable mariadb && systemctl start mariadb 

s3: create db , user with password
enter into mysql interface : sudo -u root mysql
create db: create database kodekloud_db1;
create user : create user kodekloud_rin@'%' identified by 'BruCStnMT5';
grant permission: grant all privileges on kodekloud_db1.* to 'kodekloud_rin'@'%';
cmd to check the database: show databases;
cmd to check the user : SELECT User, Host FROM mysql.user;
